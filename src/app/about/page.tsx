			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<h2>Diving Deeper into My Journey</h2>
			<p>
				After introducing myself in the hero section, I'd love to share
				more about my journey in the dynamic world of technology. My
				passion for Web3 started in early 2020 in the classic way with
				crypto and centralized exchanges, only to leave them and
				discover DEX. Little by little, I lifted the hood to understand
				how smart contracts, blockchain in general and Defi worked... I
				discovered a fascinating world and from the hole I fell into, I
				never got out again!
			</p>
			<h2>Experience and Achievements</h2>
			<p>
				Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on several
				personal and professional projects, and hackathons. Each project
				has been a driving force for me to improve my skills in smart
				contracts, API integration, frontend and backend development,
				database design, protocol understanding and so on. The most
				important thing about all these projects is the value they
				create, both for the project itself and for the learning they
				provide.
			</p>
			<h2>Continuous Learning and Collaboration</h2>
			<p>
				The landscape of data and tech in general is constantly
				changing. The Web3 landscape is even more so, requiring a
				commitment to continuous adaptation and development. It's an
				absorbing but enjoyable challenge! Collaboration is at the heart
				of my approach - I enjoy working with teams, sharing knowledge
				and learning from others.
			</p>
			<h2>Fusing Web3 Innovation with Data Engineering</h2>
			<p>
				In my work, I combine the latest in Web3 technology with solid
				data engineering practices. This blend allows me to not only
				develop decentralized applications but also to make these
				applications smarter and more user-friendly with data-driven
				insights. I'm excited about the practical, real-world
				applications of this fusion, where technology meets usability.
			</p>
			<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
			<p>
				As I look forward to my next adventure, my goal is to join a
				team or project where I can contribute significantly, especially
				in the realm of Web3 and full-stack development. I'm excited
				about the opportunities to innovate, collaborate, and develop
				solutions that make a difference.
